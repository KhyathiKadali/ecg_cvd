Flask Framework
----------------

7. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
8. Importing the packages
9. User Upload an image for analysis
10. The given input is preprocessed 
11. The trained model is used for predicting the result
12. Final Outcome is display

Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentioned to use differ extraction technique for analysis the dataset with Image Data Generator  and Deep Learning based Feature Extraction, from  which CNN got 98% of accuracy as per author, 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring Xception Transfer Learning model which got 100% accuracy,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
